# Exercise 2

## KNN Practice

**Goal:** Build two KNN models for 350 and 65 AMG trim Mercedes to
predict car price given a carâ€™s mileage.

-----

First we split the data based on whether the car has a trim level of 350
or 65 AMG. In the plot below we compare price vs mileage for each trim.

First split the data into training and test sets for both trim data

Then Plot RMSE vs K graphs to find the K which gives the minimum RMSE
for both
    models

    The KNN model with the minimum RMSE is fitted with K = 12 for a trim level of 350.

    The KNN model with the minimum RMSE is fitted with K = 10 for a trim level of 65 AMG.

Lastly, plot both models over the test data.
